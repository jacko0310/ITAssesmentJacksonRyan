<h1>Personal Information</h1>

<img src="Pocture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">

<p>I’m born and raised in Australia and my grandma on my dad’s side in Greek. I used to live in Altona but moved to Williamstown when I was 9 years old.</p>
<p>Finished year 12 in 2020 and just started my first year of Bachelor of IT in 2021.</p>
Currently I only speak English but I have some knowledge on Indonesian.
<p>I am a top competitive player for a video game known as Splatoon 2, which is a third-person shooter and is similar to paintball with different objectives within the game. I actually went to compete in the 2019 Splatoon 2 World Championships to represent Australia/New Zealand but sadly did not do too well. I’ve been playing this game since its release in July of 2017 and played in my first tournament in September of that same year. I then joined my first team in October of that same year and jumped around before joining the team I went to Worlds with in January of 2019. Currently I’m a Free Agent but am likely to join back to the team I left once the next game (Splatoon 3) releases in 2022 sometime.</p>


<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT comes from my love of video games and constant flow of new and improved technology coming into the market. Anything from headphones to remote control cars as a kid I’ve always been fascinated along with my passion for video games from the Playstation to Nintendo. There was no specific person, but back in the day my dad was very much into his music having an iPod which could have a few games on them which made me want to get one then eventually talk at school about video games on Playstation and such. I only have IT experience through years 10-12 at high school and by just troubleshooting stuff at home and helping friends. RMIT is very easy to access unlike other Universities around Victoria (especially since I still do not have my license) which makes taking the train much easier for me, my brother also went toR MIT to study Accounting and he said it was a very good University along with the teachers and the friends he met were all very welcoming. I am assuming we would be learning about
Software security, maybe how to build PCs, networking, some type of databases and bits of coding (although I’m not the biggest fan of coding).</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>I’m gonna be honest and say that I haven’t got a great understanding of the different areas in IT to know what specific area I would want a job in. But over my time of playing sports, refereeing and coaching, I think I could be well suited to an IT help desk support role, taking calls from users that may be having issues etc. Since IT is so broad I haven't found an area I specifically find more enjoyable than others, so I’m hoping to discover that during my 3-4 years doing my Bachelors or IT. This job would require good people skills, being able to actively listen to the users, thinking continuously about different problems and solutions and require solid multitasking as well as patients. From the skills I have, I would definitely need to build on my efficiency of navigating a computer and my fluency of English. These skills are already solid but definitely need to be improved if I want to become a good IT support. To be well qualified for this job I need a degree or TAFE qualification, PC Software/Hardware knowledge, proficient with Microsoft Office Package, a strong MS Access Database Skills, understanding of Active Directory, understanding of Networking (switch, router, LAN...) and HTML/Web/Java/Python coding skill. Personally I will have a degree qualification once I complete my Bachelors of IT which will come with coding, networking, MS Access and PC software/hardware experience and skills. With this I would only need an understanding of Active Directory which can easily be learned online and by fellow friends. But at this current point in time, I only have experience in PC Software/Hardware, Microsoft Office Package knowledge and a basic understanding of Python and networking.<p>






<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<p>Splatoon 2 App</p>
<p>This smart phone application will be linked to Nintendo’s third-person shooter known as Splatoon 2 to show recent matches, ranked leaderboard, a gear shop, clips from users, other youtube content and current map/mode rotations. This data retrieved from Splatoon 2 can also display win/loss percentages on certain maps/modes, where you got a splat or where you got splatted. This app's overall intention is to bring a more engaging way for players to understand what is happening in the game and the previous results without looking at their Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>This Splatoon 2 mobile application will be very popular due to no current application existing for Splatoon 2 for the current 11.9 million users that have a copy of the third-person shooter. This will also be motivating for players, as they will begin to become more engaged with the game as they look at statistics from their previous matches, clips from different players and leaderboard to become more competitive with their mates. This application opens up a huge opportunity to expand and grow the Splatoon community as well as keep current players engaged and give them possible incentives to keep coming back to the game.</p>
<p>This application will have a basic menu overviewing the current stages for the ranked modes, statics from previous battles and modes, a social media like platforms where users upload short clips or youtube links to Splatoon 2 content and a scrimmage/player finder and a build/gear creator. The home page itself will have small overviews of all the sections itself such as the results of your last 5 battles, 3 most recent clips, current maps and a profile of the current users specific ranks, gear, weapons etc. ‘Stages’ will have a list of the current ranked modes and stages for that time period (since Splatoon’s maps rotate every 2 hours) and display for all game modes in Splatoon such as Ranked Battles, Turf War, League Battles and Salmon Run. This will also have a small win percentage in the corner of each map and your best weapon for the map based on that win percentage. Next we have the ‘stats’, this will display weapon stats (kills, turf, total games played and freshness) stage stats (win percentage, best weapon for that map, most common spot for kills/death) mode stats (win percentage, objective time etc.), Current Ranked Leaderboad, Monthly Ranked Leaderboard and All-Time Ranked Leaderboard. Then for battle statistics of the users previous 50-100 battles we have a map to display where the player died and where they got their splats as well as total splats, specials and deaths for that game. Then these statistics will be calculated into a separate leaderboard of Monthly and Yearly leaderboard to display who had the most splats, least deaths, most specials etc within the certain leaderboard time frame. A custom social media platform is also available to upload up to 1 minute clips from your console directly (they can also upload to other social media platforms) as well as being able to post links to external Splatoon 2 videos from YouTube content creators for example. This custom social media platform can also be filtered into finding new people to play with, whether a player is looking to have a fun private battle, do some league battles or salmon run, a user can make a post to look for players to team up with each other. The gear/build creator will be very useful in users being able to customize their abilities and make new builds for weapons on the fly. Users will then be able to share and comment on other users' builds/gear to help eachother out so their abilities can be the most effective with a certain weapon. The user from this section of the application will then be able to order gear from the online shop using the in game currency they have earned from playing the game, they can then change and swap abilities on the app just like they can in the game to have their gear ready for when they hop on Splatoon in the future. Overall this application will be useful for both casual and competitive players of Splatoon 2 to be able to understand common strengths or weaknesses in their gameplay as well as being able to purchase customizable gear/abilities.</p>
Using an application known as Jira to code this application will allow this app to be able to retrieve data from Splatoon 2 to our smartphone application. This will then need to be coded and using mockups and page layouts to understand how the application will be designed and look appealing for the users</p>
<p>Using Python or Java would be able to achieve the data retrieval from the Splatoon 2 data storage onto the smartphone application. This data will then need to be coded into a presentable way for the users to be able to understand and engage with the data visualisations. There would not need to be any hardware besides a coding program on a computer, getting someone to code this type of application might be a stretch but has definitely been done in previous games. Mockups and layout diagrams will need to be drawn to give the coders an idea of what they need to work around.</p>
<p>If this smartphone application is successful this will engage the players of Splatoon 2 to further play the game and encourage them to improve via the monthly and yearly leaderboards. This app will likely be advertised in the apps stores and possibly branch to new users that have never seen the game before along with helping current content creators of the game grow by sharing their videos/photos on the application. This will also solve the missing application that most video games have alongside the main game, to have leaderboard, custom gear/abilities and statistics from a users point of view is a very useful tool to have in their back pocket.</p>
